# Revisiting arrays and slices with generics (DRAFT)

**[The code for this chapter is a continuation from Arrays and Slices, found here](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/tree/main/arrays)**

Take a look at both `SumAll` and `SumAllTails` that we wrote in [arrays and slices](arrays-and-slices.md). If you don't have your version please copy the code from the [arrays and slices](arrays-and-slices.md) chapter along with the tests.

```go
// Sum calculates the total from a slice of numbers.
func Sum(numbers []int) int {
	var sum int
	for _, number := range numbers {
		sum += number
	}
	return sum
}

// SumAllTails calculates the sums of all but the first number given a collection of slices.
func SumAllTails(numbersToSum ...[]int) []int {
	var sums []int
	for _, numbers := range numbersToSum {
		if len(numbers) == 0 {
			sums = append(sums, 0)
		} else {
			tail := numbers[1:]
			sums = append(sums, Sum(tail))
		}
	}

	return sums
}
```

Do you see a recurring pattern?

- Create some kind of "initial" value, or accumulator.
- Iterate over the collection, applying some kind of operation (or function) to the accumulator and the next item in the slice.
- Return the accumulator.

This idea is commonly talked about in functional programming circles, often times called 'reduce' or [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)).

> In functional programming, fold (also termed reduce, accumulate, aggregate, compress, or inject) refers to a family of higher-order functions that analyze a recursive data structure and through use of a given combining operation, recombine the results of recursively processing its constituent parts, building up a return value. Typically, a fold is presented with a combining function, a top node of a data structure, and possibly some default values to be used under certain conditions. The fold then proceeds to combine elements of the data structure's hierarchy, using the function in a systematic way.

Go has always had higher-order functions, and as of version 1.18 it also has generics, so it is now possible to define some of these functions discussed in our wider field. There's no point burying your head in the sand, this is a very common abstraction outside the Go ecosystem and it'll be beneficial to understand it.

Now I know some of you are probably cringing at this.

> Go is supposed to be simple

All I say is, **don't conflate unfamiliarity, with complexity**. Fold/reduce may initially sound scary and computer-sciencey but all it really is, is an abstraction over a very common operation. Taking a collection, and combining it into one item. When you step back, you'll realise you probably do this _a lot_.

## A generic refactor

A mistake people often make with shiny new language features is they start by using them without having a concrete use-case. They rely on conjecture and guesswork to guide their efforts.

Thankfully we've written our "useful" functions and have tests around them, so now we are free to experiment with ideas in the refactoring stage of TDD and know that whatever we're trying, has a verification of its value via our unit tests.

Using generics as a tool for simplifying code via the refactoring step is far more likely to guide you to useful improvements, rather than premature abstractions.

We are safe to try things out, re-run our tests, if we like the change we can commit. If not, just revert the change. This freedom to experiment is one of the truly huge values of TDD.

You should be familiar with the generics syntax [from the previous chapter](generics.md), try and write your own `Reduce` function and use it inside `Sum` and `SumAllTails`.

### Hints

- You only need to work with one type, but one will return `int`, the other `[]int`.
- If you think about the arguments to your function first, it'll give you a very small set of valid solutions
  - The array you want to reduce
  - Some kind of combining function

"Reduce" is an incredibly well documented pattern, there's no need to re-invent the wheel. [Read the wiki, in particular the lists section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)), it should prompt you for another argument you'll need.

> In practice, it is convenient and natural to have an initial value

### My solution

```go
// Sum calculates the total from a slice of numbers.
func Sum(numbers []int) int {
	add := func(acc, x int) int { return acc + x }
	return Reduce(numbers, 0, add)
}

// SumAllTails calculates the sums of all but the first number given a collection of slices.
func SumAllTails(numbers ...[]int) []int {
	sumTail := func(acc, x []int) []int {
		if len(x) == 0 {
			return append(acc, 0)
		} else {
			tail := x[1:]
			return append(acc, Sum(tail))
		}
	}

	return Reduce(numbers, []int{}, sumTail)
}

func Reduce[A any](collection []A, initialValue A, f func(A, A) A) A {
	var result = initialValue
	for _, x := range collection {
		result = f(result, x)
	}
	return result
}
```

`Sum` and `SumAllTails` now describe the behaviour of their computations as the functions declared on their first lines respectively. The act of running the computation on the collection is abstracted away in `Reduce`.

## Further applications of reduce

Using tests we can play around with our reduce function to see how re-usable it is. I have copied over our generic assertion functions from the previous chapter.

```go
func TestReduce(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("multiplication of all elements", func(t *testing.T) {
		numbers := []int{1, 2, 3}

		AssertEqual(
			t,
			Reduce(numbers, 1, func(x, y int) int {
				return x * y
			}),
			6,
		)
	})

	t.Run("concatenate strings", func(t *testing.T) {
		strings := []string{"a", "b", "c"}

		AssertEqual(
			t,
			Reduce(strings, "", func(x, y string) string {
				return x + y
			}),
			"abc",
		)
	})
}
```

### The zero value

In the multiplication example, we show the reason for having a default value as an argument to `Reduce`. If we relied on Go's default value of 0, we'd multiply our initial value by 0, and then the following ones, so you'd only ever get 0. By setting it to 1, the first element in the slice will stay the same, and the rest will multiply by the next elements.

If you wish to sound clever with your nerd friends, you'd call this [The Identity Element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element).

> In mathematics, an identity element, or neutral element, of a binary operation operating on a set is an element of the set which leaves unchanged every element of the set when the operation is applied.

In addition, the identity element is 0, and with multiplication it is 1.

`1 + 0 = 1`
`1 * 1 = 1`

## Wrapping up

The possibilities are endless™️. Try a few other applications of `Reduce`!

- Why not mix some `color.RGBA` into a single colour?
- Collected a list of bank transactions? Reduce them into a bank account balance.

Now that Go has generics, combining with higher-order-functions we can reduce a lot of boilerplate code within our projects.

No longer do you need to write specific `Find` functions for each type of collection you want to search, instead re-use or write a `Find` function. If you understood the `Reduce` function above, writing a `Find` function will be trivial.

When done tastefully, this will make your code simpler to read and maintain, but remember the rule of thumb: Use the TDD process to drive out real, specific behaviour that you actually need, in the refactoring stage you then _might_ discover some useful abstractions to help tidy the code up.
