# Learn go with tests

I have some experience introducing Go to development teams and have tried different approaches as to how to grow a team from some people curious about Go into highly effective writers of Go systems.

An approach we tried was to take [the blue book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) and simply work through it. I love this book but it requires a high level of commitment. The book is very detailed in explaining concepts, which is obviously great but it means that the progress is slow and steady - this is not for everyone. I found that whilst a small number of people would read chapter X and do the exercises, many people didnt.

By far the most effective way was by slowly introducing the fundamentals of the language (such as interfaces), exploring them with examples and discussing them as a group. Over time the team learns a good grounding of the _grammar_ of the language so we could then start to build systems. This was a more interactive approach than "read chapter x for homework".

When *I* learn a new programming language I usually start by messing around in a REPL but eventually I need more structure. 

What I like to do is explore concepts and then solidify the ideas with tests. Tests verify the code I write is correct and documents the feature I have learned. 

Taking my experience of learning with a group and my own personal way I am going to try and create something that hopefully proves useful to other teams. Learning the fundamentals by writing small tests so that you can then take your existing software design skills and ship some great systems. 

## Who this is for

- People who are interesting in picking up Go
- People who already know some Go, but want to explore testing more

## What you'll need

- A computer!
- [Installed Go](https://golang.org/)
- A text editor
- Some experience with programming. Understanding of concepts like `if`, variables, functions etc. 
- Comfortable with using the terminal
